We as the team members agree to these standards while we develop this game together.

1. We will be civil towards each other and respect each other's opinions at all times. 
2. If two of us have a disagreement we will try to find a compromise with the third member being a mediator if need be.
3. Descisions made based on risk should be respected and can always be looked at to implement later on in the project.
4. We should respect deadlines, but know that if we have an emergency, we can extend those deadlines.
5. The Quality should be good on all of our work and not stuff created in what looks like five minutes.
6. We should all work together on a commit to the project, and if errors ensue, the code should be shared with the member holding the main game to implement without error.
7. We all agree to these arrangements and all agree to stay polite.

Signed,
